---
## Getting started

Before installing the provider, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

### **1. Install Terraform**  
Terraform is required to use this provider. Install Terraform using one of the following methods:

#### **For macOS (using Homebrew)**
```sh
brew tap hashicorp/tap
brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
```

#### **For Windows (using chocolatey)**
```sh
choco install terraform
```

#### **For Manual installation or other platforms**
Visit [Terraform Installation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) for installation instructions.

<!-- ### 2. Install Go

#### **For macOS (using Homebrew)**
```sh
brew install go
```
#### **For Windows (using chocolatey)**
```sh
choco install golang
```
#### **For Manual installation or other platforms**
Visit [Go Setup](https://go.dev/doc/install) for installation instructions.

### 3. Finding the GOBIN Folder Path

#### **For macOS**

To check the `GOBIN` path, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
go env GOBIN
```

If it doesn't return anything, Go will use the default: `$GOPATH/bin`.

To explicitly set `GOBIN`, you can update your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.). Below are steps for `~/.zshrc`:

1. Open the file in your default editor:
   ```sh
   open ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. Add the following lines at the end of the file:
   ```sh
   export GOBIN=$HOME/go/bin
   export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN
   ```

3. Apply the changes:
   ```sh
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

4. Confirm the value:
   ```sh
   go env GOBIN
   ```

You should now see the path as `$HOME/go/bin`.

---

#### **For Windows**

To check the current `GOBIN` value, run the following in **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**:

```sh
go env GOBIN
```

If it's empty, Go defaults to `%GOPATH%\bin`. To check `GOPATH`, run:

```sh
go env GOPATH
```

> The default path is usually: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\go\bin`

To explicitly set `GOBIN`, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Start Menu** and search for **"Environment Variables"**.
2. Click **"Edit the system environment variables"**.
3. In the **System Properties** window, click **"Environment Variables…"**.
4. Under **User variables**, click **"New…"** and enter:
   - **Variable name**: `GOBIN`
   - **Variable value**: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\go\bin` (or your desired path)
5. Add `GOBIN` to your system `Path`:
   - Under **User variables**, select the `Path` variable and click **Edit**.
   - Click **New** and add: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\go\bin`
6. Click **OK** to save and exit all dialogs.
7. Restart your terminal or system.

To verify:

```sh
go env GOBIN
```

You should now see the configured GOBIN path.


> **Note:** Save the GOBIN path for later use. -->


<!-- ### 4. Download the Binary
Copy the provider binary from provider directory to the Go bin directory: 

```sh
cp provider/terraform-provider-saviynt_v0.1.3 <GOBIN PATH>/terraform-provider-saviynt
chmod +x GOBIN/terraform-provider-saviynt

```
Replace `<GOBIN PATH>` with your actual GOBIN path where the go bin folder is located. -->

<!-- ### 4. Download the Binary

Inside the `provider` directory, you will find multiple `.zip` files for different operating systems (e.g., macOS, Windows, Linux). Choose the appropriate binary for your OS, extract it, and copy the provider binary to your Go bin directory.

For example, on macOS

```sh
# Unzip the appropriate binary
unzip terraform-provider-saviynt_v0.1.6_darwin_amd64.zip -d provider/

# Copy the binary to your GOBIN directory
cp provider/terraform-provider-saviynt_v0.1.6 <GOBIN PATH>/terraform-provider-saviynt

# Make it executable
chmod +x <GOBIN PATH>/terraform-provider-saviynt
```

> **Note:** Replace `<GOBIN PATH>` with your actual GOBIN path. If you're unsure, run:
```sh
go env GOBIN
```

### - macOS Security Warning Workaround

When using the downloaded Terraform provider binary on macOS, you might encounter a security warning like:

> `"Apple is not able to verify that it is free from malware that could harm your Mac or compromise your privacy. Don’t open this unless you are certain it is from a trustworthy source.`

This happens because macOS restricts the execution of unsigned binaries.  
To work around this, you can follow either of the options below:

####  Option 1: Allow via System Settings

1. Try running the provider binary once to trigger the security warning.
2. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**.
3. Scroll down to the **Security** section.
4. You’ll see a message similar to:
   > `"terraform-provider-saviynt" was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.`
5. Click **"Allow Anyway"**.
6. Re-run your Terraform command.
7. If prompted again, click **"Open"** to allow execution.

####  Option 2: Allow via Terminal

You can also manually remove the quarantine attribute using the Terminal:

```sh
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <path-to-binary>/terraform-provider-saviynt
``` -->

<!-- ### 5. Configure `.terraformrc` or `terraform.rc`

Create the file at:

- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.terraformrc`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\terraform.rc`

```hcl
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "<PROVIDER SOURCE PATH>" = "<GOBIN PATH>"
  }
  direct {}
}
```

Note: If there is an error in Windows while running Terraform later, the user can append the `"<PROVIDER SOURCE PATH>" = "<GOBIN PATH>"` with `"<PROVIDER SOURCE PATH>" = "<GOBIN PATH>/terraform-provider-saviynt"`, while replacing the `<PROVIDER SOURCE PATH>` and `<GOBIN PATH>` with the respective paths. -->


### 2. Getting Started with Terraform

Follow the steps below to start using the Saviynt Terraform Provider:

---

#### **Step 1: Create a Terraform Project Folder**

```sh
mkdir saviynt-terraform-demo
cd saviynt-terraform-demo
```

---

#### **Step 2: Initialize a Terraform Configuration File**

Create a file named `main.tf` and define your provider and resources:

````hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    saviynt = {
      source = "saviynt/saviynt"
      version = "x.x.x"
    }
  }
}

provider "saviynt" {
  server_url  = "https://example.saviyntcloud.com"
  username   = "username"
  password   = "password"
}
````
<!-- 
Replace the `<PROVIDER SOURCE PATH>` with your provider path. The configuration should look similar to `registry.terraform.io/local/saviynt`. -->

---

#### **Step 3: Define Input Variables**

Create a file called `variables.tf` to declare your input variables:

```
variable "server_url" {
  description = "Saviynt instance base URL"
  type        = string
}

variable "username" {
  description = "Username"
  type        = string
}

variable "password" {
  description = "Password"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}
```
<!-- 
> You can refer to a sample `variables.tf` file in the `resources/connections/` folder for guidance. -->

---

#### **Step 4: Create a `terraform.tfvars` File**

This file contains the actual values for the declared variables:

```hcl
server_url   = "https://example.saviyntcloud.com"
username = "username"
password = "password"
```

> This file is automatically used by Terraform during plan and apply.

You can also name the file `prod.tfvars`, `dev.tfvars`, etc. and explicitly reference it:

```sh
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
```

> Make sure to add `terraform.tfvars` to your `.gitignore` if it contains sensitive information:

```sh
echo "terraform.tfvars" >> .gitignore
```

**Important:** When using `tfvars`, you must refer to the variables using `var.<variable_name>` syntax in your `.tf` files.  
For example, in your provider configuration or resource definitions:

```
provider "saviynt" {
  server_url = var.server_url
  username   = var.username
  password = var.password
}
```

---

#### **Step 5: Validate & Apply Configuration**

Initialise the provider:

```sh
terraform init
```

Validate the syntactic correctness of the .tf file:

```sh
terraform validate
```

Plan the changes:

```sh
terraform plan
```

Apply the changes:

```sh
terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

That's it! You've now set up and run your first configuration using the Saviynt Terraform Provider.

---

##  Usage

Here's an example of defining and managing a resource:

```
resource "saviynt_security_system_resource" "sample" {
  systemname          = "sample_security_system"
  display_name        = "sample security system"
  hostname            = "sample.system.com"
  port                = "443"
  access_add_workflow = "sample_workflow"
}
```
Here's an example of using the data source block:
```
data "saviynt_security_systems_datasource" "all" {
  connection_type = "REST"
  max             = 10
  offset          = 0
}

output "systems" {
  value = data.saviynt_security_systems_datasource.all.results
}
```

You can find the starter templates to define each supported resource type in the ```examples/``` folder. To know the differnt types of arguments that can be passed for each resource, user can refer to the ```docs/``` folder.

For inputs that require JSON config, you can give the values as in the given example:
```sh
create_account_json = jsonencode({
    "cn" : "$${cn}",
    "displayname" : "$${user.displayname}",
    "givenname" : "$${user.firstname}",
    "mail" : "$${user.email}",
    "name" : "$${user.displayname}",
    "objectClass" : ["top", "person", "organizationalPerson", "user"],
    "userAccountControl" : "544",
    "sAMAccountName" : "$${task.accountName}",
    "sn" : "$${user.lastname}",
    "title" : "$${user.title}"
  })
```
As in the above example, to pass special characters like `$`, we have to use `$$` instead and for json data, use the `jsonencode()` function to properly pass the data using terraform.

For mutliline string inputs, use `trimspace` to pass the values. Below is an example:
```sh
account_import_payload = trimspace(
    <<EOF
    <bsvc:Get_Workers_Request bsvc:version="$${API_VERSION}">
      <bsvc:Request_Criteria>
          <bsvc:Exclude_Inactive_Workers>false</bsvc:Exclude_Inactive_Workers>
          <bsvc:Exclude_Employees>false</bsvc:Exclude_Employees>
          <bsvc:Exclude_Contingent_Workers>false</bsvc:Exclude_Contingent_Workers>
          $${INCREMENTAL_IMPORT_CRITERIA}
      </bsvc:Request_Criteria>
      <bsvc:Response_Filter><bsvc:Page>$${PAGE_NUMBER}</bsvc:Page><bsvc:Count>$${PAGE_SIZE}</bsvc:Count></bsvc:Response_Filter>
      <bsvc:Response_Group>
          <bsvc:Include_Reference>true</bsvc:Include_Reference>
          <bsvc:Include_Personal_Information>true</bsvc:Include_Personal_Information>
      </bsvc:Response_Group>
  </bsvc:Get_Workers_Request>
  EOF
)
```

<!-- ##  Examples

Examples are available for all resources. Follow the following steps to try out the examples

1. Uncomment the code block corresponding to the object for which you want to try an operation (say create ad connection) in [provider.tf](provider.tf)
2. Navigate to the file corresponding to the resource that you uncommented (the uncommented code block contains the path) and update the values.
3. Review the changes using the following
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```
5. If everything works fine, apply the changes using the following
   ```
   terraform apply -var-file=<main tf file>
   ``` -->

## Known Limitations

The following limitations are present in the latest version of the provider. These are being prioritized for resolution in the upcoming release alongside new feature additions:

### 1. All Resource objects
 - `terraform destroy` is not supported.

### 2. Endpoints

- **State management is not supported** for the following attributes:
  - `Owner`
  - `ResourceOwner`
  - `Requestable`
  - `OutOfBandAccess`

- The `MappedEndpoints` field **cannot be configured during endpoint creation**; it must be managed after the endpoint is created.

- The `RequestableRoleType` attribute **can only be set during updates**, since the role must be assigned to the endpoint beforehand.

- For `saviynt_endpoint_resource.requestable_role_types.request_option`, the supported values for proper state tracking are:
  - `DropdownSingle`
  - `Table`
  - `TableOnlyAdd`

- The following service account settings are **not currently configurable via Terraform**:
  - `Disable Remove Service Account`
  - `Disable Modify Service Account`
  - `Disable New Account Request if Account Exists`

### 3. Connections
- `description` field can't be set from Terraform currently.
- **State management** is not supported for the following attributes due to their sensitive nature:
  - **AD**: `password`
  - **ADSI**: `password`
  - **DB**: `password`, `change_pass_json`
  - **EntraId**: `access_token`, `azure_mgmt_access_token`, `client_secret`, `windows_connector_json`, `connection_json`
  - **Github REST**: `connection_json`, `access_tokens`
  - **REST**: `connection_json`
  - **Salesforce**: `client_secret`, `refresh_token`
