Examples are available for all resources. Follow the following steps to try out the examples

1. Uncomment the code block corresponding to the object for which you want to try an operation (say create ad connection) in [provider.tf](provider.tf)
2. Navigate to the file corresponding to the resource that you uncommented (the uncommented code block contains the path) and update the values.
3. Review the changes using the following
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```
5. If everything works fine, apply the changes using the following
   ```
   terraform apply -var-file=<main tf file>
   ```
